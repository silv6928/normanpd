Introduction:
In this assignment we were tasked with extracting the Incidents from the NormanPD website. Saving to a database and then
printing out some things from the database. This program is written in Python3 and uses a few different packages to
get the job done.
Norman PD website - http://normanpd.normanok.gov/content/daily-activity

Attached for this project submission is a version of the database that was created from one run. I renamed it so that it would
not interfere with a run of the program.

Language:
Python 3

Requirements:
Please see the requirements.txt file in the project folder in order to know what packages are needed to run this package
You can utilize a virtual environment to download certain packaging requirements.
Please make sure you have internet connection.

How to run:
Make sure to complete the above requirements section and have the proper packages installed.
Navigate in the terminal to where the normanpd project folder is.
For example: if the normanpd project folder is in your home directory, simply make sure your current directory is ~
(cd ~)

Utilize the following command in the Linux Command terminal.

python3 ./normanpd/main.py

This will run the program utilizing python3 that you have loaded. If utilizing a virtual environment then please make sure
the virtual environment is activated and run the program using the above.

If running for a second time, please make sure the normanpd database is deleted.
